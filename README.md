## Project Overview
This project provides a Terraform-based automation solution for provisioning cloud resources efficiently. It allows users to define and deploy infrastructure as code, making infrastructure deployments reproducible and manageable.

## Features
- Modular Terraform configuration
- Parameterized variables for flexibility
- Cloud provider integration (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- State management with remote backend support
- Scalable and reusable infrastructure components

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Terraform**: Download and install from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- **Cloud Provider CLI**:
  - AWS CLI (`aws configure` for AWS authentication)
  - Azure CLI (`az login` for Azure authentication)
  - GCP SDK (`gcloud auth application-default login` for GCP authentication)
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Access Credentials**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions for resource creation on your cloud provider.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Dehaidh/Terraform-Application.git
   cd Terraform-Application
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   This command initializes Terraform, downloads necessary providers, and sets up the backend.

3. **Configure Environment Variables (if required)**
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

## Usage
1. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```
   This checks if the Terraform configuration files are syntactically valid.

2. **Generate Execution Plan**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
   This command shows what Terraform will do before applying changes.

3. **Apply Configuration**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Deploys the infrastructure as per the Terraform configuration.

4. **View Outputs**
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```
   Displays the output values defined in `outputs.tf`.

5. **Destroy Infrastructure** (when no longer needed)
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Removes all provisioned resources.

## Terraform Commands
| Command                | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `terraform init`       | Initializes the working directory               |
| `terraform validate`   | Validates the Terraform configuration           |
| `terraform plan`       | Shows an execution plan before applying changes |
| `terraform apply`      | Creates or updates the infrastructure           |
| `terraform output`     | Displays output variables                        |
| `terraform destroy`    | Destroys the deployed infrastructure            |

## Project Structure
```
Terraform-Application/
│-- main.tf            # Main Terraform configuration file
│-- variables.tf       # Variable definitions for flexibility
│-- outputs.tf         # Output definitions
│-- terraform.tfvars   # Variable values (not committed to Git)
│-- provider.tf        # Cloud provider configuration
│-- modules/           # Terraform modules (if applicable)
│-- backend.tf         # Backend configuration (for remote state)
│-- README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Best Practices
- **Use Remote State**: Store Terraform state remotely to enable collaboration.
- **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and manage infrastructure as code.
- **Use Modules**: Break down infrastructure into reusable modules.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Grant the minimum permissions required for Terraform execution.
- **Automate CI/CD**: Integrate Terraform into a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
